# Password-Generator-Project
This is the Repositiory for my Generate a Password project. We were given starter code and we were told
to add specific aspects to our generator includiing lowere and upper case letters, numbers and symbols. 
It was a very challenging activity. I loved every second of it. I am now able to create a secure password
generator using the basics of JavavScript. Here is the link! Try it out for yourself!
