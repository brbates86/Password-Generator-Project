# Password-Generator-Project
This is the Repositiory for my Generate a Password project. We were given starter code and we were told
to add to our generator code prompting the user and including specifics affecting the length of the password, 
lower and uppercase letters, numbers and symbols. It was a very challenging activity. I loved every second of 
it. I am now able to create a secure password generator using the basics of JavavScript. Here is the link! Try it out for yourself!  https://brbates86.github.io/Password-Generator-Project/
